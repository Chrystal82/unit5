//Unit 5 Assignment: Working with Files
//*********************************************************
//****Assignment 5 Section 1
//*********************************************************
// create an arraylist, named produceList, to hold the data
var produceList = []; // create empty array using the [] array literal
var producePrices = [];
//add data to the produce list
produceList.push("bananas 0.59");
produceList.push("grapes 2.99");
produceList.push("apples 1.49");
produceList.push("pears 1.39");
produceList.push("lettuce 0.99");
produceList.push("onions 0.79");
produceList.push("potatoes 0.59");
produceList.push("peaches 1.59");
// open a file, called ProducePrice.txt
//use a for loop to Write the data to a file, called ProducePrice.
// define a File System module for more see: https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_modules.asp
var filestream = require('fs');
//use the file system module's openSync method to open the file for synchronous writing and set a
//file descriptor for the open file.
var fileDesc = filestream.openSync("ProducePrice.txt",'w+');
var myRecord = "string to hold record";
for (var i=0; i< produceList.length - 1; i++)
{
//using string variable to package the record and line return neatly
myRecord = produceList[i]+"\r";
//using writeSync method to synchronously write a record to the file. In JavaScript
//we more often
//want to do tasks like this asynchronously but in this program we will be
//immediately opening the
//file for reading and we have to be sure the writes are done. This could also be
//accomplished
//through callback functions but that is a more advanced JavaScript topic.
filestream.writeSync(fileDesc, myRecord);
}
//we will write the last record separately so we can leave off the return character \r
//if not we will have a blank record at the end of the file.
//we could have done this inside the loop with an IF statement but that is far more processing
//overhead to check the condition with every iteration.
filestream.writeSync(fileDesc, produceList[i]);//last record without line return.
//close the file
filestream.closeSync(fileDesc);
//write a function, FileLineCount()
//that will return the number of lines in a file
//using the function call, display the number of items in the file.
//"There are xx products in the file."
//see function definition at the bottom of this program
console.log("There are " + FileLineCount("ProducePrice.txt") + " products in the file.");
console.log();
//*********************************************************
//****Assignment 5 Section 2
//*********************************************************
// add four more items to the file
//with node.js's fs.appendFileSync we can write a record without explicitely opening the file
//however, if a large number of writes were needed, opening the file explicitely would likely
//require far less overhead.
//last item in the file does not have a line return character so we need to start our first
//write with a \r
filestream.appendFileSync('ProducePrice.txt', '\rpeppers 0.99\r');
filestream.appendFileSync('ProducePrice.txt', 'celery 1.29\r');
filestream.appendFileSync('ProducePrice.txt', 'cabbage 0.79\r');
filestream.appendFileSync('ProducePrice.txt', 'tomatoes 1.19'); // leave off \r for last record
//display the number of items in the produce file now
console.log("There are " + FileLineCount("ProducePrice.txt") + " products in the file.\n");
//*********************************************************
//****Assignment 5 Section 3
//*********************************************************
//read the contents of the file ProducePrice.txt into a new arraylist called producePrices
//we've aready done this in the function below to count the number of records.
producePrices = filestream.readFileSync("ProducePrice.txt").toString().split("\r");
var lineCounter = 0; //used to number the lines written to the console and control the loop
while (lineCounter < producePrices.length)
{
console.log((lineCounter+1) + ". " + producePrices[lineCounter]);
lineCounter++;
}
console.log("\nThere are " + producePrices.length + " products in the producePrices arraylist.");
//function FileLineCount accepts string value of file name and returns count of items in file
function FileLineCount(fileName)
{
var tempList = [];
//define a new file system module so this function can be indepent of any calling code.
var fs = require('fs');
//the file system module's readFileSync method does not require us to open the file first.
//using the toString and .split methods we can easily parse the file into separate array
//elements doing so gives us a means for obtaining the record count without a loop. For
//very large files this might not be memory efficient. An asynchronous method with a
//callback function might be a better choice
tempList = fs.readFileSync(fileName).toString().split("\r");
return tempList.length;
